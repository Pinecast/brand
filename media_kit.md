## About Pinecast

Pinecast is a podcast hosting service, founded in 2015 by Matt Basta. As a podcaster, he was dissatisfied with the hosting service options available at the time. Pinecast was an attempt to build something that worked for him and his friends, and developed into one of the most versatile and feature-rich podcast hosting services of its time. Founded in California and operated in Raleigh, North Carolina, Pinecast is loved by thousands of podcasters around the world, serving billions of listens over its half-decade online.
