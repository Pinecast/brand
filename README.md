# Pinecast Branding

- [Media Kit](https://github.com/Pinecast/brand/blob/master/media_kit.md)

## Asset Guidelines

The Pinecast monochrome logo should only be used in monochrome-only contexts.

On a dark gray or black background, a white logo should be used instead of the green logo. Similarly, the logotype should always be either black or white. Other than black, white, and green, no other colors should be used as part of the combination mark.

On a light background, a green logo should be used. The logotype should always be black on a white background.

Don't use the green Pinecast logo on colored backgrounds. A white logo should be used on colored backgrounds. If the background is a very light color, a black logo should be used. The logotype should match the color of the logo in these cases.

When used on pages as an accent (e.g., in a website footer), the logo and logotype may be filled with `#BBBBBB`. This should not be used in marketing or promotional material.

The Pinecast logo may be used on its own as a mask for a color photo. The photo must not draw attention away from the logo shape, or have similar coloration to the background of the logo (obscuring the logo's edges). Do not use the logotype when doing this.


### Things to not do

- Don't adjust the positioning of the logotype relative to the logo.
- Don't use any colors other than those described above.
- Don't add borders, shadows, or other accents of any kind to the logo.
- Don't change the opacity of the logo.
- Don't rotate, distort, or stretch the logo.
- Don't overlay the Pinecast logo with other logos or graphics.
- Don't use the Pinecast logotype without the logo or in conjunction with other logos.
- Don't use the Pinecast brand in a way that implies endorsement, affiliation, or support without explicit permission.
